.. _pbm-status:


Checking status of |PBM|
******************************************************

As of version 1.4.0, you can check the status of |pbm| running in your MongoDB environment using the :command:`pbm status` command. 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm status

The output provides the information about:

- Your MongoDB deployment and ``pbm-agents`` running in it: to what ``mongod`` node each agent is connected, the |pbm| version it runs and the agent's state
- The currently running backups / restores, if any
- Backups stored in the remote backup storage: backup name, completion time, size and status (complete, canceled, failed)
- :term:`Point-in-Time Recovery` status (enabled or disabled).
- Valid time ranges for point-in-time recovery and the data size

This simplifies troubleshooting since the whole information is provided in one place.
