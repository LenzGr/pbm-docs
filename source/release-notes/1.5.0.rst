================================================================================
*Percona Backup for MongoDB* 1.5.0
================================================================================

:Date: May 10, 2021
:Installation: `Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/installation.html>`_

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

.. important::

   Backups made with previous versions are incompatible for restore with Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.5.0. This is because processing of system collections ``users`` and ``roles`` has changed during backup / restore operations. For details, refer to :ref:`pbm.running.backup.restoring` and :jirabug:`PBM-636`. 

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-596`: Azure Blob Storage support
* :jirabug:`PBM-488`: Create weight or tag method to influence with ``pbm-agent`` node will do backups



Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-662`: Show PITR Status based on ``admin.pbmLock`` instead of config settings
* :jirabug:`PBM-494`: Prefer a (healthy) hidden secondary to any other node in automatic selection



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-642`: Display ``priority=0`` members on agent list in ``pbm status`` output
* :jirabug:`PBM-636`: Different collection UUID after restore (Thanks to Nikolay for reporting this issue and Dmitry Kuzmin for contributing)
* :jirabug:`PBM-646`: Stop the balancer during backup to make sure it doesn't start running during restore
* :jirabug:`PBM-635`: Wait for the leader's metadata before starting backups
* :jirabug:`PBM-490`: Use cluster time for the snapshot start time
