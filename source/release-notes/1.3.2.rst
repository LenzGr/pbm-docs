:Installation: `Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/installation.html>`_

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-426`: Add AWS KMS key encryption/decryption for S3 buckets 

  Config format

  
  .. code-block:: yaml
  
     storage:
       s3:
         serverSideEncryption:
           sseAlgorithm: "aws:kms"
           kmsKeyID: "........"
   
  
  (Thanks to user pedroalb for reporting this issue)



Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-568`: Print uploadPartSize value to log during backup
* :jirabug:`PBM-560`: Use s2 compression as default for ``pbm-speed-test`` instead of gzip



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-485`: Fix backups to S3 failing with ``MaxUploadParts`` limit by auto-adjusting ``uploadPartSize`` value (Thanks to user pedroalb for reporting this issue) 
* :jirabug:`PBM-559`: pbm-agent runs out of memory while doing restore of large backup (Thanks to user Simon Bernier St-Pierre for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PBM-562`: Correct calculation of available PITR time ranges by pbm list 
* :jirabug:`PBM-561`: Fix setting of numeric options in config
* :jirabug:`PBM-547`: Allow deleting backups from local filesystem by moving delete operations to pbm-agents
