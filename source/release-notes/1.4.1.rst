Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-621`: Show incomplete backups in ``pbm status`` output
* :jirabug:`PBM-619`: Optimise response time from storage for ``pbm status``
* :jirabug:`PBM-615`: Check backup validity for current cluster
* :jirabug:`PBM-608`: Enable Kerberos authentication for PBM by adding support for GSSAPI
* :jirabug:`PBM-478`: Prevent restore from incomplete backup
* :jirabug:`PBM-610`: Fix response time from GCS for ``pbm status`` command



Bugs Fixed
