:Installation: `Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/installation.html>`_

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-345`: Centralize logs
* :jirabug:`PBM-435`: ``pbm status`` command



Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-572`: Change backup 'name' in 'pbm list' etc to be consistent time (~= end time) rather than start time
* :jirabug:`PBM-556`: Introduce operation ID



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-595`: Shard backup with different rset name
* :jirabug:`PBM-604`: Compression flag for 'pbm list' command doesn't change the output
* :jirabug:`PBM-602`: Empty PITR files are created on storage if PBM fails to upload oplog chunk due to insufficient range
* :jirabug:`PBM-597`: Properly handle mongo fail while PITR slicing is enabled
