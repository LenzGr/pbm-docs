Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-586`: Add a request timeout to the S3 downloader during the restore
* :jirabug:`PBM-584`: Ignore shard configuration during the restore



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-555`: Fix the " error demultiplexing archive" error during restore by downloading backup from s3 storage in chunks
* :jirabug:`PBM-460`: Restore fails with conflicting namespace destinations (Thanks to user pedroalb for reporting this issue)
